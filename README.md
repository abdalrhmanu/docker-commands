# Docker Commands
#### Grouping most of the basic docker commands in a clean and simple markdown. All of these commands are found in the official docs. However, I am grouping here those I use the most for faster reach. <br /><br />

Category 1. Exploring running containers and images

| Command             | Description    				  	 			  						                                  
| ------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------|
| `docker ps`         | docker ps groups exposed ports into a single range. Can display container ID, name,  date created, port, etc.. This command will only list running containers not the stopped ones. |
|` docker ps --help`  | wil list down all flags that can be used with docker ps. |
| `docker ps --a`     | wil list down all containers including those stopped |
| `docker ps --aq`    | wil list down all containers ids (only ids) including those stopped |
